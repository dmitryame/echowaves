#
#  Base class for Workling Runners.
#
#  Runners must subclass this and implement the method
#
#     Workling::Remote::Runners::Base#run(clazz, method, options = {})
#
#  which is responsible for pushing the requested job into the background. Depending
#  on the Runner, this may require other code to dequeue the job. The actual
#  invocation of the runner should be done like this:
#
#      Workling.find(clazz, method).dispatch_to_worker_method(method, options)
#
#  This ensures for consistent logging and handling of propagated exceptions. You can
#  also call the convenience method
#
#      Workling::Remote::Runners::Base#dispatch!(clazz, method, options)
#
#  which invokes this for you.
#
