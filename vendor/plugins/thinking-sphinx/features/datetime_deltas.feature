Feature: Datetime Delta Indexing
  In order to have delta indexing on frequently-updated sites
  Developers
  Should be able to use an existing datetime column to track changes

  Scenario: Delta Index should not fire automatically
    Given Sphinx is running
    And I am searching on thetas
    When I search for one
    Then I should get 1 result

    When I change the name of theta one to eleven
    And I wait for Sphinx to catch up
    And I search for one
    Then I should get 1 result

    When I search for eleven
    Then I should get 0 results

  Scenario: Delta Index should fire when jobs are run
    Given Sphinx is running
    And I am searching on thetas
    When I search for two
    Then I should get 1 result

    When I change the name of theta two to twelve
    And I wait for Sphinx to catch up
    And I search for twelve
    Then I should get 0 results

    When I index the theta datetime delta
    And I wait for Sphinx to catch up
    And I search for twelve
    Then I should get 1 result

    When I search for two
    Then I should get 0 results

  Scenario: New records should be merged into the core index
    Given Sphinx is running
    And I am searching on thetas
    When I search for thirteen
    Then I should get 0 results

    When I create a new theta named thirteen
    And I search for thirteen
    Then I should get 0 results

    When I index the theta datetime delta
    And I wait for Sphinx to catch up
    And I search for thirteen
    Then I should get 1 result

    When I search for the document id of theta thirteen in the theta_core index
    Then it should exist

  Scenario: Deleting records
    Given Sphinx is running
    And I am searching on thetas
    When I search for three
    Then I should get 1 result

    When I delete the theta named three
    And I wait for Sphinx to catch up
    And I search for three
    Then I should get 0 results
