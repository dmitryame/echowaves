    # Authlogic looks like ActiveRecord, sounds like ActiveRecord, but its not ActiveRecord. That's the goal here.
    # This is useful for the various rails helper methods such as form_for, error_messages_for, or any method that
    # expects an ActiveRecord object. The point is to disguise the object as an ActiveRecord object so we can take
    # advantage of the many ActiveRecord tools.
