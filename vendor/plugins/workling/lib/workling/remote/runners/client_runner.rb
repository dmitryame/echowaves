#
#  Runs Jobs over a Client. The client should be a subclass of Workling::Client::Base.
#  Set the client like this:
#
#      Workling::Remote::Runners::ClientRunner.client = Workling::Clients::AmqpClient.new
#
#  Jobs are dispatched by requesting them on the Client. The Runner takes care of mapping of queue names to worker code.
#  this is done with Workling::ClassAndMethodRouting, but you can use your own by sublassing Workling::Routing.
#  Don’t worry about any of this if you’re not dealing directly with the queues.
#
#  There’s a workling-client daemon that uses the configured invoker to retrieve work and dispatching these to the
#  responsible workers. If you intend to run this on a remote machine, then just check out your rails project
#  there and start up the workling client like this: ruby script/workling_client run.
