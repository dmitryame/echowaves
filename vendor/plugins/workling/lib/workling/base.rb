#
#  All worker classes must inherit from this class, and be saved in app/workers.
#
#  The Worker lifecycle:
#    The Worker is loaded once, at which point the instance method 'create' is called.
#
#  Invoking Workers:
#    Calling async_my_method on the worker class will trigger background work.
#    This means that the loaded Worker instance will receive a call to the method
#    my_method(:uid => "thisjobsuid2348732947923").
#
#    The Worker method must have a single hash argument. Note that the job :uid will
#    be merged into the hash.
