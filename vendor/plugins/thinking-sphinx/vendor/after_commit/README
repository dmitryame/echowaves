after_commit
===========

A Ruby on Rails plugin to add after_commit callbacks. The callbacks that are provided can be used
to trigger events that run only after the entire transaction is complete. This is beneficial
in situations where you are doing asynchronous processing and need committed objects.

The following callbacks are provided:

   * (1) after_commit
   * (2) after_commit_on_create
   * (3) after_commit_on_update
   * (4) after_commit_on_destroy

The after_commit callback is run for any object that has just been committed. You can obtain finer
callback control by using the additional <tt>after_commit_on_*</tt> callbacks.
